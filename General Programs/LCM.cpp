//function to find LCM of 2 numbers
//The LCM of two integers n1 and n2 is the smallest positive integer that is perfectly divisible by both n1 and n2 (without a remainder)

//eg- LCM of 72 and 120 = 360

//LCM = (num1*num2)/GCD
//GCD= greatest common divisor/HCF
//The HCF or GCD of two integers is the largest integer that can exactly divide both numbers (without a remainder).
