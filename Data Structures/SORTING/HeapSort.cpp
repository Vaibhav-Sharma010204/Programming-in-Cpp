/*HEAP SORT-heap sort is a comparison sorting technique which is based on Binary HEAP which is a form of ordered Complete binary tree.
Algorithm-
1)Build a heap
2) Build a MAX-HEAP where the parent node has data larger than its children nodes.
3) After building the max heap, we simply swap the root and the last node , and delete the last node from HEAP.


We will build a BINARY HEAP using array based implementation as it is space efficient.
