/*PROGRAM FOR QUICK-SORT
TIME COMPLEXITY- WORST CASE - O(N^2) , BEST CASE/AVG CASE - O(nlogn)
ALGORITHMIC STRATEGY- DIVIDE AND CONQUER

QUICK sort is the best sorting approach for all practical problems, due to its efficiency.
Quick sort is an IN-PLACE sorting algorithm, i.e it requires constant amount of extra memory ,sorting without any extra space requirement.
Also in worst case scenario of O(n^2) is often ignored due to the RANDOMIZED VERSION OF QUICK SORT which gives the highest probability of O(nlogn)
